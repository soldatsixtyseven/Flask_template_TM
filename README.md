# Basic Flask Application for 3rd Year Gymnasium Students as part of their Maturity Project

## Author
Johan Jobin, Collège du Sud.

## Description
The current directory is as a foundational Flask template connected to an SQLite database, serving as a starting point for 3rd-year students at Collège du Sud as for their Maturity Project. With pedagogical objectives in mind, and to provide a fundamental grasp of web application architecture, the project intentionally omits any Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) or data validation modules.
